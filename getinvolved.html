          <p>
            There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are
            very welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
            accessible to the whole community.

          <p>
            You can also support us by donating items of interest to the
            museum’s collections. If you have some item or collection that you
            think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our
            Collections Department and they will be able to assist you.

          <h3>Volunteer</h3>
          <p>
            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
            displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
            Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
            scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
            monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
            discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
            contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you can get
            involved.
